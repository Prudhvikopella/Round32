## ✨ Notes on Customization and Design Adjustments

- 🔙 **Filter & Back Buttons Removed**: These UI elements were non-functional in the provided reference, so they were removed from the Home screen for cleaner UX.
- 🧩 **Tab Repositioning**: The tabs were adjusted slightly lower for improved visual hierarchy and design consistency.
- 🤖 **Auto Hi Message**: Introduced to simulate an engaging conversation starter.
- 🖼️ **Photo Scroll Performance**: Some stutter is observed in scrolling due to high-resolution images. Images have been partially optimized for this assessment; a deeper optimization (e.g., dynamic resizing or compression) is feasible in a full implementation.
- ⏱️ **Time-Conscious Decisions**: As this was an assessment with limited time, certain advanced optimizations were deferred, showcasing not just technical ability but also smart prioritization. I consciously noted what could be improved further and would tackle those in a full-scale app.
